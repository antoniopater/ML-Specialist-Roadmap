### Supervised Learning

Supervised learning involves algorithms that learn to map input (x) to output (y) based on provided examples.
A key element is providing the algorithm with examples with correct answers, which allows it to predict output based on new inputs.
Application Examples

Examples of supervised learning applications include:
spam filters, speech recognition, machine translation, and online advertising, where algorithms predict whether a user will click on an ad.
In industry, algorithms can assess the quality of products, for example, by checking if a phone has scratches or dents.
Regression and Classification

Regression is a type of supervised learning that involves predicting numerical values, such as house prices, based on input data.
Classification, which will be discussed in the next section, is the second main type of supervised learning problem, involving assigning labels to data.
