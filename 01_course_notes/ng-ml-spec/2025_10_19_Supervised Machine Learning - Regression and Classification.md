## Supervised Learning

### Supervised learning - definition 

Supervised learning involves algorithms that learn to map input (x) to output (y) based on provided examples.
A key element is providing the algorithm with examples with correct answers, which allows it to predict output based on new inputs.
Application Examples

Examples of supervised learning applications include:
spam filters, speech recognition, machine translation, and online advertising, where algorithms predict whether a user will click on an ad.
In industry, algorithms can assess the quality of products, for example, by checking if a phone has scratches or dents.

### Regression and Classification

Regression is a type of supervised learning that involves predicting numerical values, such as house prices, based on input data.
Classification, which will be discussed in the next section, is the second main type of supervised learning problem, involving assigning labels to data.

A supervised learning algorithm takes a dataset containing input features (e.g., house size) and output targets (e.g., house price).
The model learns from this data, creating a function that predicts an output value based on new inputs.

### Model and Function

A function, denoted f, takes an input x and produces a predicted value y-hat, which is an estimate of the actual value y.
In the context of linear regression, f is represented as a straight line, making it easier to calculate and interpret.

### Linear Regression

Univariate linear regression is a basic model that can be extended to more complex models with multiple variables.

A key element in model construction is the cost function, which is crucial in machine learning.
